## Self discipline and willpower

Self-discipline refers to the control you have over yourself i.e. the control you have over your emotions, feelings, behaviors, actions, and thoughts.

When you are self-disciplined, you easily control your urges to indulge in any unhealthy or unconstructive activity that can affect your productivity, and easily stick to your mission and goal.

Willpower is the ability to stay motivated and overcome laziness. Motivation is a small burst of energy that compels you to achieve your goals and when that burst ends you'll end up back where you started from. But, if you are disciplined you won't need any motivation to be productive.

Self-discipline is an ability that you have to learn and it's very hard to learn it but once you do you'll be unstoppable.

## Stop making excuses

Stop making excuses and start doing the things you wanna do. Your brain will tell you not to do something new or somethings that uncomfortable at first but you can trick by keep doing that task over and over again.

Record your progress and celebrate every small win that you make and to become truly self disciplined you'll need to remove all the distractions that stop you from being productive.
